I'm a software engineer with a love for turning complexity into purposeful systems.
I mix structure with creativity, designing databases, building AI projects, and crafting immersive game systems with my own art in it. 
I love working alongside others just as much as diving into solo passion projects. 
Curiosity keeps me moving and I believe the best systems, like a great life, are built on purpose, resilience, patience, and understanding.
